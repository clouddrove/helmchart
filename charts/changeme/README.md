| `autoscaling.minReplicas` | The minimum amount of replicas allowed | `1` |
| `autoscaling.maxReplicas` | The maximum amount of replicas allowed | `100` |
| `autoscaling.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage` | The target average CPU utilization to be used with the metrics | `80` |
| `nodeSelector` | nodeSelector specify restrictions on what node this pod should be scheduled on. | `{}` |
| `tolerations` | tolerations can be used to allow the pod to be scheduled on nodes with a specific taint. | `[]` |
| `affinity` | affinity specify restrictions on what node this pod should be scheduled on. | `{}` |
